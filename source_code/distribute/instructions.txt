THE PROBLEM:

A collection of customers are entering and leaving a coffee shop. We have a list of their entry and exit times. We would like to compute during which time period the coffee shop was fullest.

For example, if
 * Alice entered at 1 and left at 2, and
 * Bob entered at 1:30 and left and 2:30, and
 * Eve entered at 12:00 and left at 1:45

 then the busiest time was between 1:30 and 1:45, when the coffeeshop had 3 people in it.

 See the provided code for more information.
